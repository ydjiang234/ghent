I am writing to apply for the postdoc position (vacancy 5), which was announced on your personal website. As a PhD student majoring in Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology at the University School for Advanced Studies IUSS Pavia, I have already past the doctoral defence and my expected graduation date is May 2018.

Your posted vacancy 5, which focused on the non-destructive inspection of 3D printed metal parts with PCRT technique, has deeply attracted me as it and is closely connected with the industry.

Although have been doing research in the Structural Engineering filed, I have completed a series courses related to dynamic and vibration, e.g. "Structural Dynamics" and "Seismic Response and Analysis of Structures". In fact, as a PhD student specialized in Earthquake Engineering, I have analysed the response spectrum of real ground motion and evaluated the structure performance under earthquake excitation in my doctoral research. Thus, I believe my background in dynamic prepares me to adapt to the vacancy 5 fast and smoothly. 

My curriculum vitae is enclosed for your kind perusal. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Yadong Jiang
PhD Candidate, Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology
University School for Advanced Studies IUSS Pavia, Pavia, Italy
University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy
